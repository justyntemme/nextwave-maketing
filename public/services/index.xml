      <description>Social Media is a large playing field spanning multiple demographics. Without the proper guide it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to get lost almost as if at sea. Here at NextWave we work with large social media influencers in order to make sure every dollar spent is one that make an impact for the client. Don&amp;rsquo;t waste your money on incorrectly promoted tweets that don&amp;rsquo;t product engagements.</description>
